# License Plate Registration

This project implements a license plate detection and recognition system using deep learning models (YOLOv3 and YOLOv8).

## Project Structure
- Jupyter notebooks for development and training
- Model configurations and weights
- Training data and annotations
- Utility scripts for processing

## Setup
1. Install Git LFS to handle large files
2. Clone the repository
3. Install dependencies (requirements.txt)
4. Download model weights (if not included in repository)

## Large Files
This project uses Git LFS for managing large files such as:
- Model weights (.weights, .h5, .pt files)
- Datasets
- Large CSV files

## Note
Some large files and datasets might need to be downloaded separately. Check the documentation or contact the repository owner for access to these files.
